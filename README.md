# Pixel-Chatting-App

This is for my social media app, created using Python and Java in 9th grade. (Now I want to open-source it.)
main.py is the old version, main new.py is the updated version, working in 2025.

The app mainly uses Kivy and Kivymd, and I also used jnius for Java support.
Features:-

Libraries used so far:- **kivy, android, kivymd, sqlite3, webbrowser, Pillow, multiprocessing, jnius, pymysql, kivyauth**
